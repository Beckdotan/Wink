# Wink

An android app that helps couples to "keep the fire going". 
We allow the couple to communicate in a way they have never done before by sending beautiful "notes" to each other.
A note is a small gesture that they make for each other. it can be sent by time, pin by location or immediate sent. It looks like an Instagram story (including pictures gifs text drawings and more.

This is a final project for the Milab - HCI and innovation lab at IDC.
